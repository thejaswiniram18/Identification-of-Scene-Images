# Identification-of-Scene-Images
Object Identification and classification are classical problems where we  need to identify the objects in images. In our project, we aim to recognize the  important buildings of our college in images. We plan on using YOLO, which is one  of the most effective object detection algorithms, to accomplish this task.
